        <h1>Understanding who I am as a person</h1>
        <p>
            My walk through life has led me to meet a lot of interesting people, do a lot of really cool things, and experience a lot of exhilarating adventures. During the warmer months, I enjoy traveling and kayaking in Lake Washington. During the colder months, I’ll definitely be up north, tearing it up on some steep mountain slope. Although, most of the year, you’ll find me behind a computer screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a young age, I was fascinated by computers. Learning to code has been my single most favorite hobby (next to playing the violin and fishing that is) and it is part of the reason for the existence of this website. I look forward to sharing the challenges I face, the things I find meaningful, and new insights I have.

        <h1>Where I come from</h1>
        <p>
            I grew up in the Canadian equivalent of Seattle: Vancouver. Here you’ll find nice people, good food, and a whole lot of rain. For the first 6 years of my life, Vancouver and Richmond were my stomping grounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s been well over 10 years since I left Vancouver, and since then, I have made several great friends and met several famous people along the way. This is my world, and it’s a messy one full of emotions and ideas. Step into my life and you will find a very disorganized desk with papers in five distinct piles: important things (miscellaneous), homework, textbooks, other books, and finally poetry. Each pile has its uses even if I don’t know what it may be at the moment.

        <h1>What I do</h1>
        <p>
            I’m a student, first and foremost. While other priorities may take up my time, learning is my biggest priority. I have a curiosity about everything. Give me an electronic device and I’ll ask you how it works, offer me some food and I’ll thank you and ask about the ingredients, teach me something new and I’ll ask why until I’m satisfied. To live life and not question it is to lead a meaningless life in my opinion. Innovation doesn’t result from the complacency of a class of students, it springs from a well of curiosity and a thirst for the answers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asides from being a student, I like to take naps and taste good food. Sleeping assists in growing and I need as much assistance as i can get. As for trying good food, my goal is to one day visit each continent once and taste its fine delicacies. Having tasted so much good food already, I thought it would nice to learn to make my own as well. This website exists to document my journey through life

            <span><strong>Competitions?</strong></span>
            Why yes, I do many competitions. From Science Olympiad to DECA, I have had a very fulfilling high school experience in this regard. From late-night cramming to post-awards excitement, competing represent some of my best memories from high school.

        <h1>What are my passions</h1>
        <p>
            Between school and competitions, there is still time left in between. I like to fill those long hours with violin playing, deep-sea fishing, computer programming, reading chinese novels, skiing, ramen, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I challenged a friend in my research lab to a spicy ramen eating contest (hachi ramen x2 hotness). Unfortunately, I lost, and the experience of eating wasn’t all too pleasant. But it was a unique opportunity to bond with my fellow lab members and we shared a great time (at the expense of my taste buds).
